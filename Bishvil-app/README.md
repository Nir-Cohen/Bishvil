# FirebaseCrud

## This is the code for a tutorial series that can be found on [progblog.io](https://progblog.io)

In this tutorial we start with a blank app generated using Angular CLI. We use [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to make the next steps EASY. First, we use Firebase's authentication to add Google Login. We later extend that to also use email/password. We then use the Firebase Realtime Database to make a simple chat app. This project is my attempt to show how easy Firebase makes seemingly arduous tasks.

### Sections

**Part 5:** COMING SOON Adding the ability for a user to edit or delete any messages that they have sent.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to Github Pages.
